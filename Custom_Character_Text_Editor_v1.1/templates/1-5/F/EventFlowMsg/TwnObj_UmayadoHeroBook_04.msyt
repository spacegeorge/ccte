I eventually had to\ndrag [K.02Obj] out of the water.\n[KName] gazed at me for the longest time\nwith heartbreaking vulnerability.\n\nEventually, in a tiny voice, [K.01Sub] told me\nof the pressure and panic [K.01Sub][K.feel] at\nnot being able to fulfill [K.03PD] sacred duty.\n[K.01Sub^] whispered over and over, \"Why can I\nnot do as the past royal wielders of this\npower have done? What is wrong with me?\" \nAll I could do was hold [K.02Obj] close\nand listen... I pray that it is enough."

I refuse to sit idly by.\nGanon is also closely associated\nwith the Gerudo...an association\nI deeply resent.\nI believe [KName] will be here soon to\nreceive my official answer.
