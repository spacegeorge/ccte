I must learn all I\ncan about the relics so we can stop him.\nIf the fortune-teller's prophecy is to be\nbelieved, there isn't much time left...\n\nAh, but turning over these thoughts in\nmy head puts me ill at ease.

The feeling stayed with\nme so long, I grew anxious and weary.\nIt is the same feeling I've felt before in\n[P.03PD] company... And still, not a word\npasses [P.03PD] lips.\nI never know what [P.01Sub][P.'s] thinking! It\nmakes my imagination run wild, guessing\nat what [P.01Sub][P.is] thinking but will not say.\nWhat does the girl chosen by the sword\nthat seals the darkness think of me?\nWill I ever truly know?\nThen, I suppose it's simple. A daughter\nof Hyrule's royal family yet unable to use\nsealing magic... [P.01Sub^] must despise me."

But [P.01Sub] did.\nWith so much at stake, and so many eyes\nupon [P.02Obj], [P.01Sub][P.feel] it necessary to stay\nstrong and to silently bear any burden.\nA feeling I know all too well... For [P.02Obj],\nit has caused [P.02Obj] to stop outwardly\nexpressing [P.03PD] thoughts and feelings.\nI always believed [P.02Obj] to be simply a\ngifted person who had never faced a\nday of hardship. How wrong I was...\nEveryone has struggles that go unseen\nby the world... I was so absorbed with\nmy own problems, I failed to see [P.04PP].\nI wish to talk with [P.02Obj] more and to see\nwhat lies beneath those calm waters,\nto hear [P.02Obj] speak freely and openly...\nAnd perhaps I, too, will be able to bare\nmy soul to [P.02Obj] and share the demons\nthat have plagued me all these years."

He told\nme I am to have nothing more to do with\nresearching ancient technology.\nHe insisted that I focus instead on\ntraining that will help me awaken\nmy sealing magic.\nI was so frustrated and ashamed I could\nnot even speak. I've been training since\nI was a child, and yet...\nMother passed the year before my\ntraining was to begin. In losing her,\nI lost not just a mother, but a teacher.\nMother used to smile and tell me,\n\"[KName], my love, all will be well in\nthe end. You can do anything.\"\nBut she was wrong. No matter how I try\nor how much time passes...the sealing\npower that is my birthright evades me.\nTomorrow I journey with [PName] to the\nSpring of Power to train. But this, too,\nwill end in failure. Such is my curse."
